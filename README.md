# Gesture-Recognition-Toolkit

## Project Overview
Gesture-Recognition-Toolkit is a versatile library for recognizing hand gestures from images or video streams. This toolkit provides implementations for both traditional machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), and modern deep learning methods. It aims to offer an easy-to-use interface for training, evaluating, and deploying gesture recognition models in various applications.

## Features
- Support for multiple hand gesture recognition approaches including SVM and deep learning models.
- Data preprocessing and augmentation techniques to improve model performance.
- Examples of training custom models on public gesture recognition datasets.
- Evaluation scripts to measure model accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Streamlined pipeline for deploying models to production.
